# gulp-md-img-base64
A gulp plug-in to compress and convert images (especially screenshot *.png) to base64.
In early version, it can only be used to compress and convert an image (png format) and write into a json.
Hopefully later it can perform as gulp-css-base64, that is, to replace an image path string with the base64 code.
